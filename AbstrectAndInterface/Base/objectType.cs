         * object (System.Object) is the ultimate base class for all types. Any type can be upcast to object. 
         * 
         * To illustrate how this is useful, consider a general-purpose stack. A stack is a data structure based on the principle of LIFO—“last in, first out.” A stack has two operations: push an object on the stack, and pop an object off thestack.
